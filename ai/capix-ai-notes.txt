CAPIX develops and sells software to corporate treasury operations in several countries. 
An important part of this software is cash management and cashflow forecasting across multiple currencies.
Data is imported from the ERP systems of these large corporations, and cashflow data such as accounts payable, accounts receivable and budgets is used to prepare cashflow forecasts.
CAPIX wants to develop Artifical Intelligence software to improve the cashflow forecasting. Suggest the best Artifical Intelligence model and tools to achieve this?
