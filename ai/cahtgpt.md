To improve cashflow forecasting for CAPIX's corporate treasury clients using AI, the best approach combines time series forecasting with contextual data modeling. Here‚Äôs a comprehensive strategy including the most suitable models and tools:

---

### üîç **1. AI Strategy Overview**
CAPIX deals with multi-currency, multi-source, complex financial data. The objective is to **predict future cashflows** more accurately by using historical ERP data (accounts payable, receivable, budgets, etc.) and potentially external factors (exchange rates, seasonality, economic indicators).

---

### üß† **Recommended AI Models**

#### **A. Hybrid Deep Learning Model**
Use a **hybrid architecture** that combines:
- **LSTM/GRU (Long Short-Term Memory / Gated Recurrent Units):** For capturing temporal dependencies in time series data like AP/AR trends.
- **Transformer-based models (e.g., Temporal Fusion Transformer):** These handle multi-horizon forecasting with richer interpretability and handle missing/irregular data well.
- **XGBoost or LightGBM:** For structured tabular data like budgets, calendar-based events, or macroeconomic indicators that don't have strong time dependencies.

This hybrid approach allows leveraging deep learning for sequential patterns and gradient boosting for contextual features.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Tools and Frameworks**

#### **Core Machine Learning & Deep Learning Frameworks**
- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow/Keras** ‚Äì For LSTM, GRU, Transformer models.
- **Darts (by Unit8)** ‚Äì Python library that wraps around PyTorch and others for easy time series forecasting (supports LSTM, TFT, Prophet, etc.).
- **GluonTS (AWS) or Kats (Meta)** ‚Äì Libraries specialized for probabilistic and interpretable time series forecasting.

#### **Supporting Tools**
- **Pandas + NumPy + scikit-learn** ‚Äì For data preprocessing, feature engineering, and traditional ML models.
- **Apache Airflow** ‚Äì For managing and scheduling model training pipelines and data ingestion from ERP systems.
- **MLflow** or **Weights & Biases** ‚Äì For experiment tracking, model performance monitoring, and versioning.

### üåê **External Data Enrichment (Optional but Valuable)**
- **Exchange rate data (e.g., via fixer.io, Open Exchange Rates)**
- **Macroeconomic indicators** (GDP forecasts, inflation, central bank rates)
- **Industry-specific trends and seasonal patterns**

These can be integrated as features to improve forecasting under economic volatility.

---

### üîÑ **Deployment & Integration**
- **Containerization:** Dockerize the forecasting service for easy deployment in client environments.
- **REST API or gRPC endpoints:** So forecasts can be pulled on-demand by the treasury software.
- **Batch or streaming data ingestion:** Depending on how often cashflow data changes.

---

### üß™ **Forecast Evaluation Metrics**
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- Prediction intervals and confidence scores (for risk-aware forecasting)
