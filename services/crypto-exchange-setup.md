CAPIX has been delivering software solutions for the treasury sector since 1991. We’ve accumulated world-class expertise in the capital and financial markets.

The Block Chain and Crypto coin ecosystem started around 2014 as a technical novelty for computer enthusiasts.

Block Chain and Crypto has now matured into it’s second generation as a serious business and financial system.

CAPIX is uniquely positioned to assist bank, broking and corporate clients participate in this new and exciting world. Almost all Crypto broking or exchange operations are based on the “Peatio” open-source trading platform. Peatio is the name of an ancient mythical Chinese dragon.

Peatio has grown in size and sophistication just as the Block Chain ecosystem has. It is an exciting and challenging collection of software components based on micro-services.

Building, implementing and running a Peatio-based crypto business is complex and difficult. Under-estimating the challenge will lead to failure.

CAPIX has the business, operations and technical expertise to assist building a successful crypto exchange business. Our experience started in the 1980s when the Foreign Exchange markets were deregulated. We’ve been involved in all of the market developments and trends over thirty years.

Spot, Forward, CFD, Options, Exotics – we know Forex.

Past Forex projects have including Arbitrage Engines, interfaces to Liquidity Providers and High Frequency Trading.

CAPIX can apply the efficiency and sophistication of the Forex markets to Block Chain and Crypto projects. The Ethereum Block Chain and ecosystem represents the second generation and wider application of the initial Bitcoin network.

Ethereum allows “Smart Contracts” to be written in the Solidity programming language. Almost all of the thousands of new crypto coins and tokens are implemented as Ethereum Smart Contracts. Most common are the ERC20 and ERC721 tokens.

CAPIX has the experience and expertise to develop Smart Contracts to allow your business to join the Block Chain. Payment systems have had changed rapidly over the past decade and the wide-spread adoption of Block Chain technology has accelerated this.

While Bitcoin has proven too slow and expensive for real-time payments, newer Block Chains and Coins such as Ripple (XRP) have emerged as viable alternatives to systems such as SWIFT.

CAPIX has experience with a wide variety of payment systems and protocols, from SWIFT and BITS, to Austraclear and Euroclear, the FIX protocol and more recently FAST and RESTFul. All Financial Services businesses have Compliance requirements, including “Know Your Client” (KYC) and “Anti-Money Laundering” (AML) procedures.

CAPIX can assist establishing world-class Compliance procedures and systems, including statutory reporting.

In the past we have implemented interfaces for ATO, ASIC and Austrac electronic reports. Professional Accounting and Risk Management is often the missing link in Crypto Exchange operations.

Our decades of treasury experience, and especially Foreign Exchange, means we are experts of this domain. We are uniquely positioned to help deliver best-practice financial procedures and systems.
