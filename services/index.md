### Analysis, Consulting and Project Management

CAPIX offers a complete range of Professional Services to assi​st with the​ implementation of CAPIX software. Over the past twenty years we have sucessfully completed over a hundred implementation projects for clients in eight countries.

Our extensive domain kn​owledge within the treasury and securities sector enables us to apply the expertise needed for even the most complex and detailed business requirements.

### Software Customisation and Development of CAPIX products.

Often clients want CAPIX software customised to suit their specific requirements, either during the implementation project or over the lifetime of the system.

Much of the custom software development we perform for clients is relatively simple, such as custom reports that integrate into the CAPIX packages. The CAPIX Report Manager offers extensive flexibility, but sometimes clients require new reports and we can deliver these without fuss.

On occasion we undertake more extensive projects and have even have developed whole new modules on behalf of clients.

### Contract Software Engineering

We apply our deep industry and software development expertise for companies in the Financial Services sector. Our combination of deep software development skills with Microsoft technology and treasury and securities business expertise positions us well to complete bespoke software application projects of any size.

One project was a wholesale Bond Trading internet portal for Commonwealth Bank. This internet Bond trading portal supported Bond trading between the bank and clients in both the primary and secondary markets. The first version of this project was completed to a tight deadline and was live in six weeks.

Other similar projects have been for trading short and long term Debt Securities using internet portals.
